# Sensor Immersion
These are the programming tutorials that help you learn about how the micro:bit, gator:bit, and clippable sensors work together to collect data and create data displays.

## Lesson 2
The Tutorials in this lesson explore how the micro:bit communicates with the sensors to collect data.
